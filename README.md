👋 Hello! I’m Arun Kurian
I’m an aspiring Software Developer currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Applied IT at the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec) in New Zealand. My technical journey is a blend of rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, giving me a broad skill set across programming languages, frameworks, and IT domains. My focus is on building intuitive, efficient, and high-performance applications that make a difference.

With experience in C#, Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS, I am well-versed in .NET MAUI for developing cross-platform applications. My projects range from data-intensive GUI apps to console programs utilizing advanced data structures, such as Binary Search Trees, to tackle complex problems. I’ve built a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development, applying principles of object-oriented programming and UI/UX design to create seamless user experiences.
